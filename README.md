This is a Tic-tac-toe game developed with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

Most of the project was done using just basic Python. Pygame was used for GUI and Event Handling.

## Features

The project contains 3 main parts: the home screen, the singleplayer mode and the multiplayer mode.

In every mode of playing you can go back to the home screen by pressing "Esc". Also, you can restart the current game by pressing "R" and you can quit the game by pressing "Q".

### Homescreen

It gives access to the two ways of playing by clicking on the respective text.

### Singleplayer

Here, you are facing an unbeatable bot that is playing as O. 
You are playing as X and can make a move by clicking an empty cell in the grid.

Good luck!

Notes:

1. The bot was programmed using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and optimized using [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).
This way it is making optimal moves in no time.

2. If you somehow manage to beat it please report it by sending a screenshot of the game to: blahoviciandrei1@gmail.com

### Multiplayer

In this mode you are to play with a friend from the same PC. The GUI is very intuitive as
you know every time whose turn is. As in singleplayer you make moves by clicking an empty cell in the grid.
At the end you will see a text of the winner or a message that says "It's a tie!".

## How to run

1. Double click Install.vbs
2. Now, a window that should get you through Python installation should open. 
(If you already have Python installed on your machine just close the window and jump to step 5)
3. Before clicking "Install Now" make sure you check "Add Python 3.8 to PATH", it is essential for the game in order to run.
4. After the installation is done, click Close.
5. Open the game by double clicking the Tictactoe.vbs file
